[[ 'sources' ]]
# This section should contain several subsections which describe Debian
# apt repositories.
#
# Each subsection contains information for an individual apt repository. It
# must include a description, uri, suite and component field. The name of
# the subsection (ie. the quoted string between [[[ and ]]]) is used as the
# filename for the list (eg. /etc/apt/sources.list.d/<name>.list).
#
# Fields:-
# description - One line description of repository.
# uri         - Debian repository URI (aka Debian mirror). This URI is used
#               throughout the bootstrap and build components of the build
#               process. Debian package caching is recommended with tools such
#               as approx or apt-cacher-ng.
# final_uri   - This URI is published to the sources.list snippet at the final
#               stages of the build process. If ommitted, $uri is used.
# suite       - Suite name(s) (eg. "sid" or "sid experimental").
# components  - Repository components (eg. "main" or "main contrib non-free").
# keyring     - Name of package containing gpg key required for authentication
# gpgkey      - 8 character gpg keyid fetchable from keyserver
#		or
#		absolute filename to exported public key
#		or
#		http/ftp URI to exported public key

# These are the defaults for the Debian repository, uncomment and modify as
# required.
